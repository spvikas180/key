Furthermore, you will also now be able to benefit from our staking offering with respect to certain cryptoassets by participating in our reward program.<br><br>Additionally, as a client of eToro UK you now benefit from the enhanced protection of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) - the UK's compensation fund, which covers clients up to an equivalent of £85,000 per client - in relation to regulated transactions (specifically, securities and CFDs). Please note that cryptoassets are unregulated, and therefore are excluded from the protection applicable to regulated investment services.<br><br>We may convert your existing cryptoasset CFD positions into real/physical cryptoassets. We may also convert any non-leveraged stock CFD positions to real securities positions. You will continue to have the same economic exposure to the cryptoassets/stocks that you had under the original CFD positions (same number of cryptoasset/stock units and the open price), however. The new real cryptoassets/stocks bought on your behalf will be held in a custody account according to our terms. Please note that the migration of positions may constitute a tax event on your part.

If you do not accept we may not be able to continue to offer you cryptoasset CFDs and may have to close all your open cryptoasset CFD positions.</b><br><br>eToro, a global group of regulated entities, aims at all times to provide its clients with the best available investment and trading experience, based on each client’s profile and trading activity. Due to certain changes in our cryptoassets CFDs offering in eToro Australia we would like to provide you with the option to become a customer of eToro UK Limited (“eToro UK”), our FCA regulated company. Migrating your account to eToro UK will enable you to invest in real cryptoassets and securities in addition to trading CFDs (except for cryptoassets which can only be traded as underlying assets). This will involve closing your account with eToro AUS Capital Pty Ltd. (“eToro AUS”) and at the same time migrating your account and client money to eToro UK.<br><br>If you do not wish to have your account transferred to eToro UK we may not be able to allow you to trade in cryptoassets CFDs anymore and/or other products due to changes in our products offering and you will need to close all such open positions within 7 business days as of the date of the first notice to you. If you do not close these open positions yourself, we have the right to close all such open positions that you have not closed at this time.<br><br>As part of the migration process, we will convert your existing cryptoassets positions and non-leveraged securities CFD into their underlying asset. You will continue to have the same economic exposure to the cryptoassets/stocks that you had under the original CFD positions (the same number of cryptoassets/stocks units and open price). The new underlying cryptoassets/stocks bought will be held by us on your behalf. Conversion of positions may constitute a tax event on your part. Please consult your tax advisor.<br><br>Owning an underlying (non-CFD) cryptoasset means that you may be able to transfer such cryptoassets to a wallet account operated by the eToro group. Furthermore, you will be able to benefit from our staking service with respect to certain cryptoassets by participating in our reward program and our Free stock offering for UK clients.<br><br>If you fund your account by wire transfer, after you migrate, please make sure to check the updated bank account details (see Payment Method). The previous bank account details you used will no longer be relevant.<br><br>When your account is transferred your relationship will cease to be regulated by ASIC and you will no longer be able to bring claims with the Australian Financial Complaints Authority. UK laws and regulations are also different to the Australian laws and regulation. As a client of eToro UK, you will benefit from the protection of the UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”), which covers clients up to an equivalent of £85,000 per client, in relation to regulated transactions (for example securities and CFDs). Cryptoassets are unregulated in the UK, and, therefore, are excluded from FCA and FSCS protection. Clients categorised by eToro UK as retail are subject to certain regulatory leverage limitations in respect of CFD transactions and are restricted from trading cryptoasset CFDs.","termsAndConditionsToAsicFromLogin.policies":"I acknowledge that my information will be used in accordance with the <a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"{{:: $ctrl.data.UrlDescriptions['docType2']['url']}}\">{{:: $ctrl.data.UrlDescriptions['docType2']['urlName']}}</a> and <a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"{{:: $ctrl.data.UrlDescriptions['docType3']['url']}}\">{{:: $ctrl.data.UrlDescriptions['docType3']['urlName']}}</a>.","termsAndConditionsToAsicFromLogin.productDisclosure":"I accept the <a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"{{:: $ctrl.data.UrlDescriptions['docType1']['url']}}\">{{:: $ctrl.data.UrlDescriptions['docType1']['urlName']}}</a> of {{:: $ctrl.data.newSubsidiaryShortName }} ({{:: $ctrl.data.newRegulatorShortName }} Regulated) and <a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"{{:: $ctrl.data.UrlDescriptions['docType4']['url']}}\">{{:: $ctrl.data.UrlDescriptions['docType4']['urlName']}}</a>.","termsAndConditionsToAsicFromLogin.title":"Transfer of your account to eToro UK","termsAndConditionsToAsicGaml.confirmChange":"I agree","termsAndConditionsToAsicGaml.content":"You are currently trading with {{:: $ctrl.data.currentSubsidiaryLongName }} under {{:: $ctrl.data.currentRegulatorShortName }} rules and ESMA regulations, which impose leverage and margin restrictions on retail clients. eToro, being a global group of regulated entities, enables clients who have indicated a wish to trade with leverage, the option to become a customer of eToro AUS Capital Pty Ltd.

Instead, a new product, <b>Non-Deliverable Cryptoassets (“NDC”), will become available to you.</b><br><br>Although we offer the NDC trading service, the eToro investment platform is not an exchange or a market. This means that you can only enter into NDC trades with us on the platform, and not with third parties. eToro will hold NDCs on your behalf. You will also not generally have the right to vote, stake, or otherwise participate in any events or actions that may occur in relation to the NDC. Therefore, our services are limited to you buying and selling the NDC on our platform.<br><br>In addition, you will generally not be able to transfer your NDCs out of your eToro account, including for the purposes of selling that NDC on another platform or to another person, or transfer NDCs into the eToro wallet or into your eToro account from a different account.<br><br>As cryptoassets are unregulated, when you use our NDC trading service, you will not benefit from the protections available to clients receiving regulated investment services such as CFD cryptoassets. For example, you will not be able to make complaints to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission or the Australian Financial Compensation Authority. Also, money you provide to us in relation to NDC trading will not need to be held by us as client money held in a client money account, and you will therefore be subject to eToro counterparty risk.<br><br>For your convenience, you will find eToro AUS Capital Pty Ltd. and eToro Service’s customer documentation linked below: <a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"{{financialProductTermsUrl}}\">Financial Product Terms</a> (is defined as relating to the eToro NDC offering), <a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"{{productDisclosureStatementUrl}}\">Product Disclosure Statement</a>, <a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"{{financialServicesGuideUrl}}\">Financial Services Guide</a>, <a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"{{privacyPolicyUrl}}\">Privacy Policy</a> and <a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"{{cookiePolicyUrl}}\">Cookie Policy</a>.","updateTncForAsicGamlByInteraction.policies":"I acknowledge that my information will be used in accordance with the <a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"{{:: $ctrl.data.UrlDescriptions['docType2']['url']}}\">{{:: $ctrl.data.UrlDescriptions['docType2']['urlName']}}</a> and <a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"{{:: $ctrl.data.UrlDescriptions['docType3']['url']}}\">{{:: $ctrl.data.UrlDescriptions['docType3']['urlName']}}</a>.","updateTncForAsicGamlByInteraction.productDisclosure":"I accept the {{:: $ctrl.data.newSubsidiaryShortName}} <a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"{{:: $ctrl.data.UrlDescriptions['docType1']['url']}}\">{{:: $ctrl.data.UrlDescriptions['docType1']['urlName']}}</a>, <a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"{{:: $ctrl.data.UrlDescriptions['docType5']['url']}}\">{{:: $ctrl.data.UrlDescriptions['docType5']['urlName']}}</a> and <a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"{{:: $ctrl.data.UrlDescriptions['docType6']['url']}}\">{{:: $ctrl.data.UrlDescriptions['docType6']['urlName']}}</a>","updateTncForAsicGamlByInteraction.submit":"Got it","updateTncForAsicGamlByInteraction.title":"Offering a new product: Non-Deliverable Cryptoasset","updateTncForNDFByInteraction.content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
