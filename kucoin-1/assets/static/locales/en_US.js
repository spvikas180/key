The activity will last until the early August. During the activity period, the USDT-TRON holders will get airdrop as bonus returns and the highest annualized rate of the return is up to 20%.  KuCoin will offer full support to this activity and users transferring USDT into this activity will get the corresponding bonus returns based on the USDT amount.

For example, when price of BTC rises by 1%, the price of BTC3L will rise by 3% and the price of BTC3S will drop by 3%. Unlike margin trading or futures trading, no collateral or margin maintenance is required to hold leveraged tokens, and there are no liquidation risks. Note that leveraged tokens may experience high price volatility. Traders should be prudent with their investments.","etf.question.two":"How do KuCoin Leveraged Tokens work?","etf.answer.two":"Each KuCoin Leveraged Token is a unit share of a leveraged fund. The fund manager ensures that the fund returns are based on a specific multiple of the underlying asset and that traders can gain that specific multiple of profits of the underlying asset. When the price volatility on the opposite side exceeds the threshold, a rebalancing mechanism is used to hedge risks to control the net loss.","etf.question.three":"When should I hold KuCoin Leveraged Tokens?","etf.answer.three":"The rebalancing mechanism makes KuCoin Leveraged Tokens a good choice for one-sided market moves but a poor choice for fluctuating markets.

Having started coding at the age of 8 and founded his first startup at the age of 16, Michael immediately started to mine BTC when he heard about Bitcoin 2012 from his boss Eric in 2021. But when he tried to sell some BTC on Mt. Gox, he discovered that what was the world's largest platform at the time was difficult for beginners to use. As the adoption of blockchain continued, Michael and Eric realized that it was reshaping the financial system into one that would not only serve richest few, but everyone in the world - even the less educated, unemployed, and unbanked. By the end of 2013, they wrote KuCoin\u2019s first pieces of code in a cafe, beginning the journey of a People\u2019s Exchange that would allow everyone to get involved with crypto.
